		"Controlled Experiment on the Comprehension of Runtime Phenomena Using Models at Runtime"

			abstract 
				"Utilizing models for software construction is a well-studied research topic. Recent research investigates the integration of models into running systems to provide additional information about the system configuration at runtime. While this additional information enables innovative self-adaptive mechanisms, it is still an open research question if the information provided by models can also improve the analysis capabilities of human users where manual intervention is inevitable for investigating runtime phenomena. This paper contributes to fill this gap by conducting a controlled experiment where the correctness and completion time of tasks regarding runtime information are assessed. A control and experiment group had to analyze the output of a software system, and the experiment group additionally received traceability links between models and associated runtime records. The results show that improvements of the analysis can especially be observed where model elements emphasize relationships between system parts that are hardly recognizable in the implementation code."

			abstract 
				"Domain modeling is an important step in the transition from natural-language requirements to precise specifications. For large systems, building a domain model manually is a laborious task. Several approaches exist to assist engineers with this task, whereby candidate domain model elements are automatically extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Despite the existing work on domain model extraction, important facets remain under-explored: (1) there is limited empirical evidence about the usefulness of existing extraction rules (heuristics) when applied in industrial settings; (2) existing extraction rules do not adequately exploit the natural-language dependencies detected by modern NLP technologies; and (3) an important class of rules developed by the information retrieval community for information extraction remains unutilized for building domain models.
Motivated by addressing the above limitations, we develop a domain model extractor by bringing together existing extraction rules in the software engineering literature, extending these rules with complementary rules from the information retrieval literature, and proposing new rules to better exploit results obtained from modern NLP dependency parsers. We apply our model extractor to four industrial requirements documents, reporting on the frequency of different extraction rules being applied. We conduct an expert study over one of these documents, investigating the accuracy and overall effectiveness of our domain model extractor."

		"Unifying Explanatory and Constructive Modeling"
		    authors
		        "Thomas Kühne" email "thomas.kuehne@ecs.vuw.ac.nz" homepage "http://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Main/ThomasKuehne"
		    abstract
		        "The universal agreement regarding modeling as a useful endeavor can hide the large divide that runs through the modeling community. The differences between explanatory and constructive modeling give rise to two almost disjoint modeling universes, each based on different, mutually incompatible assumptions, rules, and tools. This division is undesirable as it prevents modelers from fluently transitioning between these worlds and denies them the benefits afforded by the underpinnings of the opposite camp. In this paper I characterize the typing disciplines underlying these different schools of thought, identify their respective trade-offs, and propose a unified approach which treats the different world views as modes of modeling that one may transition into in either direction. I present a unifying typing framework that can form the basis for a mutual fertilization between the hitherto rather separated worlds of explanatory versus constructive modeling."

                "In order to optimize the use of resources of interdependent systems we need to perform strategic analysis of resources. Game theory is the discipline of science that studies strategy. Epistemic game theory explores how individuals reason about others choices for decision making. This theory can play a vital role for optimizing the use of distributed resources since our systems are continuously providing support for decision making where the outcome of a decision is dependent on other systems. We use a model driven approach to build a bridge between software models and epistemic game theory. In this initial work, we have shown how software models such as entity models may be used for building epistemic models. We propose an algorithm for constructing epistemic models where conflict situations are represented with the use of diagrammatic constraints. We use examples from the healthcare domain to explain the proposed technique."

                "Signal-flow diagrams, state-space models and finite-state machines are established modeling concepts in embedded controller software development. However, in the emerging areas of automated driving and human-robot collaboration, the dynamic management of system and environmental objects is mandatory. For this, object-oriented concepts are required in addition to the established modeling concepts. This paper demonstrates the application of signal-flow diagrams together with object-oriented models in Modern C++ for the software development in the area of submicroscopic traffic control. Both the vehicle dynamics and the longitudinal controllers are modeled as signal-flow diagrams and state-space models. Above this control layer, the dynamic creation and removal of individual vehicles and environmental objects are modeled in Modern C++. Together with Boost odeint these models are directly represented on a high abstraction level. Modern C++ is no longer limited to programming but is used as an object-oriented modeling language both for reliable embedded software and simulation environments."

Arguably, the Eclipse ecosystem has been and continues to be one of the most important modeling tool repositories and sources of information about these tools, with, for example, more than 180,000 posts in the modeling forums since 2002. In this paper, we collect and analyze the content of the 30 most widely used Eclipse forums associated with different modeling and MDE tools, such as EMF, Xtext, ATL, Epsilon, and GMF. Using state-of-the-art text mining techniques coupled with manual analysis, we explore these forums with respect to two important questions: What are the primary issues, problems, and challenges raised in the use of these tools? And, perhaps even more important: Which of these issues are most commonly faced by newbies in the MDE community?"

First, it accepts as input a larger subset of the UML/OCL language; in particular, it supports UML generalization, along with generalization-related OCL operators. Secondly, it generates as output a class of satisfiability problems that can be efficiently handled by SMT solvers with finite model finding capabilities. We report on a non-trivial case study and draw comparisons with related tools."

                "Prefetching and caching are well-known techniques integrated in database engines and file systems in order to speed-up data access. They have been studied for decades and have proven their efficiency to improve the performance of I/O intensive applications. Existing solutions do not fit well with scalable model persistence frameworks because the prefetcher operates at the data level, ignoring potential optimizations based on the information available at the metamodel level.  Furthermore, prefetching components are common in relational databases but typically missing (or rather limited) in NoSQL databases, a common option for model storage nowadays. To overcome this situation we propose PrefetchML, a framework that executes prefetching and caching strategies over models. Our solution embeds a DSL to precisely configure the prefetching rules to follow. Our experiments show that PrefetchML provides a significant execution time speedup. Tool support is fully available online."

                "This paper presents an approach for modeling multi-device user interactions, based on task models. We use ConcurTaskTrees (CTTs) as a domain-specific language, which we  extend here by a labeling mechanism to model multi-device interactive applications. While CTTs are used to specify temporal and causal relations between tasks, we add operators to specify the device mapping in a flexible and expressive way. The main novelty is the introduction of the two new operators, Any and All, to specify if a task should be executed on any or on all of a set of devices. We show that this is applicable in scenarios of connected, smart devices where a task can be executed on a multitude of devices. We present formal semantics for our extension of CTTs as well as a tool chain based on the Qt toolkit for generating code for distributed UIs. This includes a mapping from high-level tasks to concrete UI controls and a distributed execution model based on state machines. The new concepts are validated in several case studies."

                "Annerose Braune"
            abstract
                "Declarative mapping models aim at simplifying the development of model transformations by separating (1) the configuration of mappings between elements of the source and target meta-model and (2) the execution of these mappings. Existing solutions however require an extended definition of the mappings that, e.g., also describes how generated elements need to be connected. In this paper, we propose a generic transformation algorithm that is able to execute mappings that do not specify such extended information by analyzing the structure of the target meta-model. This limits the effort necessary for the definition of mappings and ensures a valid target model already at early stages of development. After analyzing the tasks that model transformations needs to perform, we present our approach towards generic transformation rules for models that are based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and illustrate a concrete implementation by means of an integration into our own model transformation framework."

                "A key selling point of MDE is the increase in productivity by automatically generating code from models. However, the practical adoption of code generation remains relatively slow and limited to niche applications. Tooling issues are often pointed out but more fundamentally, experience shows that: (i) models and modeling languages used for other purposes are not necessarily well suited for code generation and (ii) code generators are often seen as black-boxes which are not easy to trust and produce sub-optimal code. This paper presents our experiences applying ThingML to different domains. ThingML includes a modeling language and tool designed for supporting code generation and a highly customizable multi-platform code generation framework. The approach is implemented in an open-source tool providing a family of code generators targeting heterogeneous platforms. It has been evaluated through several case studies and is being used for in the development of a commercial ambient assisted living system."

Goal: We aim at systematically mining GitHub projects to answer the question when models, if used, are created and updated throughout the whole project's life-span. Method: We present a semi-automated approach to collect UML stored in images, .xmi, and .uml files and scanned ten percent of all GitHub projects (1.24 million). Our focus was on number and role of contributors that created/updated models and the time span during which this happened. Results: We identified and studied 21316 UML diagrams within 3454 projects. Conclusion: Creating/updating of UML happens most often during a very short phase at the project start.  For 12% of the models duplicates were found, which are in average spread across 1.88 projects. Finally, we contribute a list of GitHub projects that include UML files."

            abstract
                "Most of current modeling languages are based on graphical diagrams. The concrete graphical syntax of these languages typically is defined informally – by text and diagram examples. Only recently, starting from UML 2.5, a formalism is offered for defining the graphical syntax of UML. This formalism is based on Diagram Definition standard by OMG, where the main emphasis is on enabling diagram interchange between different tools implementing the given language. While this is crucial for standardized languages such as UML, this aspect is not so important for domain specific languages. In this paper an approach is offered for simple direct definition of concrete graphical syntax by means of metamodels. Metamodels are typically used for language definition, but mainly the MOF-inspired approach via metametamodel instantiation is used. We offer an alternative approach based on core metamodel specialization, which leads to a more direct and understandable definition, staying at the same meta-layer. In addition, our approach permits a natural extension – a facility for graphical editor definition for the given language, which is vital in the world of DSLs. In contrast to most DSL development platforms which are based on abstract syntax metamodel of the language and a mapping to graphics our facility is based directly on the graphical syntax."

                "Model Finding is an established method to increase the confidence in the correctness of a UML/OCL model, e.g., by automatically determining valid system states or counterexamples. In the recent past, numerous approaches have been proposed for this purpose. In order to cope with the underlying complexity, approaches based on satisfiability solvers have been found promising. They require a translation of all OCL constraints of the model for a corresponding solver. In this paper, SMT-based model finding is investigated. It is shown that certain OCL operations are causing huge SMT formulations which harm the solving process. However, this is not necessary if a fixed structure of the model can be assumed. Motivated by this, a new concept called ground setting properties is introduced which allows for an efficient translation of OCL into SMT. This concept is illustrated by means of a running example and compared to existing solutions."

Key building block in the tool environment supporting this vision is a highly-customizable code generation process. Customization is performed via a configuration specification which describes  the ways in which input is provided to the component, the ways in which run-time execution information can be observed, and how these observations drive animation tools. The environment is envisioned to be suitable for different activities ranging from quality assurance to supporting certification, teaching, and outreach and will be built exclusively with open source tools to increase impact. A preliminary prototype implementation is described."

                "Model transformation programs evolve through a process of continuous change. However, this process may weaken the design of the transformation programs and make it unnecessarily complex, leading to increased fault-proneness. Refactoring improves the software design while preserving overall functionality and behavior. However, very few studies addressed the problem of refactoring model transformation programs.  These existing studies provided an entirely manual or semi-automated refactoring support to transformation languages such as ATL. In this paper, we propose a fully-automated search-based approach to refactor model transformations based on a multi-objective algorithm that recommends the best refactoring sequence (e.g., extract rule, merge rules, etc.) optimizing a set of ATL-based quality metrics (e.g. number of rules, coupling, etc.). To validate our approach, we apply it to a comprehensive dataset of model transformations. The statistical analysis of our experiments over 30 runs shows that our automated approach recommended useful refactorings based on a benchmark of ATL transformations and compared to random search, mono-objective search formulation and a semi-automated refactoring approach not based on heuristic search."

However, the problem of state machines synthesis from contracts has not been researched. In this paper, this problem is investigated and a suitable procedure for protocol state machine generation is presented. This procedure is based on a method used in specification-based testing; it is formally defined, stepwise and based on a well-defined mathematical model. Its applicability is demonstrated on a bank account example often used in the literature. It is shown that resulting protocol state machines help to grasp the meaning of specifications and, as a side effect, to identify flaws in the specification such as unreachable states."

In this paper, we present the methodology we followed to systematically derive mutation operators for use case models. More specifically, we proposed a defect taxonomy defining 94 defect types, based on the IEEE Std. 830-1998 standard; we systematically applied the basic guide words of the standardized Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methodology to define 191 mutation operators; we defined a set of guidelines for devising defect seeding strategies. The proposed approach was evaluated by a real world case study and results show that the derived mutation operators are feasible to apply and the defect taxonomy is the most comprehensive one to compare with the literature."

We target specifically tasks that apply to or manipulate models, such as model definition, model well-formedness checking, and model transformation. In our framework, we view the model-set selection as a multi-objective optimization problem. The framework can be tailored to the learning or testing of a specific task by firstly expressing the coverage criterion, which will be encoded as a first optimization objective. The coverage is expressed by tagging the subset of the input metamodel that is relevant to the considered task. Then, one or more minimality criteria are selected as additional optimization objectives. We illustrate the use of our framework with the testing of metamodels. This case study shows that the multi-objective approach gives better results than random and mono-objective selections."

But how to characterize a realistic model used in software and systems engineering? This question is investigated in the paper by collecting over 17 different widely used graph metrics taken from other disciplines (e.g. network theory) and evaluating them on 83 instance models originating from six modeling domains. Our preliminary results show that certain metrics are similar within a domain, but differ greatly between domains, which makes them suitable input for future instance model generators to derive more realistic models."

Whilst XMI is widely supported, the XMI parser provided by EMF is inefficient in some cases where models are read-only (such as input models for model query, model-to-model transformation, etc) as it always requires loading the entire model into memory. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, and a prototype implementation (SmartSAX), which is capable of partially loading models persisted in XMI.  SmartSAX offers improved performance, in terms of loading time and memory footprint, over the default EMF XMI parser. We describe the algorithm in detail, and present benchmarking results that demonstrate the substantial improvements of the prototype implementation over the XMI parser provided by EMF."

                "View models are key concepts of domain-specific modeling to provide task-specific focus (e.g., power or communication architecture of a system) to the designers by highlighting only the relevant aspects of the system. View models can be specified by unidirectional forward transformations (frequently captured by graph queries), and automatically maintained upon changes of the underlying source model using incremental transformation techniques. However, tracing back complex changes from one or more abstract view to the underlying source model is a challenging task, which, in general, requires the simultaneous analysis of transformation specifications and well-formedness constraints to create valid changes in the source model. In this paper we introduce a novel delta-based backward transformation technique using SAT solvers to synthetize valid and consistent change candidates in the source model, where only forward transformation rules are specified for the view models."

                "In this work we propose a feature location approach that targets models as the feature realization artifacts. The approach combines Genetic Algorithms and Information Retrieval techniques. Given a model and a feature description, model fragments extracted from the model are evolved using genetic operations. Then, Formal Concept Analysis is used to cluster the model fragments based on their common attributes into feature realization candidates. Finally, Latent Semantic Analysis is used to rank the candidates based on the similarity with the feature description. As a result, the genetic algorithm evolves the population of model fragments to find the set of most suitable feature realizations. We have evaluated the approach with an industrial case study, locating features with precision and recall values around 90% (baseline obtains less than 40%). Finally, we provide recommendations on how to provide the input to the approach to improve the location of features over the models."

Simulations continuously create, destroy and reorganize constituent elements causing their interactions to dynamically change. For example, the multi-cellular tissue development process coordinates molecular, cellular and tissue scale objects with biochemical, biomechanical, spatial and behavioral processes to form a dynamic network.  Different domain specific languages can describe these components in isolation, but cannot describe their interactions. No current programming language is designed to represent in human readable and reusable form the domain specific knowledge contained in these components and interactions. We present a new hybrid programming language paradigm that naturally expresses the complex multi-scale objects and dynamic interactions in a unified way and allows domain knowledge to be captured, searched, formalized,  extracted and reused."

                "The usefulness of a system specification depends in part on the completeness of the requirements. However, enumerating all necessary requirements is difficult, especially when requirements interact with an unpredictable environment. A specification built with an idealized environmental view is incomplete if it does not include requirements to handle non-idealized behavior. Often incomplete requirements are not detected until implementation, testing, or worse, after deployment. Even when performed during requirements analysis, detecting incomplete requirements is typically an error prone, tedious, and manual task. This paper introduces Ares, a design-time approach for detecting incomplete requirements decomposition using symbolic analysis of hierarchical requirements models. We illustrate our approach by applying Ares to a requirements model of an industry-based automotive adaptive cruise control system. Ares is able to automatically detect specific instances of incomplete requirements decompositions at design-time, many of which are subtle and would be difficult to detect, either manually or with testing."

                "Evolution in software systems is a necessary activity that occurs due to fixing bugs, adding functionality or improving system quality. Systems often need to be shown to comply with regulatory standards. Along with demonstrating compliance, an artifact, called an assurance case, is often produced to show that the system indeed satisfies the property imposed by the standard (e.g., safety, privacy, security, etc.). Since each of the system, the standard, and the assurance case can be presented as a model, we propose the extension and use of traditional model management operators to aid in the reuse of parts of the assurance case when the system undergoes an evolution. Specifically, we present a model management approach that eventually produces a partial evolved assurance case and guidelines to help the assurance engineer in completing it. We demonstrate how our approach works on an automotive subsystem regulated by the ISO 26262 standard."

Engineering artifacts stored in model repositories are developed in either offline (checkout- modify-commit) or online (GoogleDoc-style) scenarios. Com- plex systems frequently integrate models and components developed by different teams, vendors and suppliers. Thus confidentiality and integrity of design artifacts need to be protected by access control policies. We propose a technique for secure collaborative modeling where (1) fine-grained access control for models can be defined by model queries, and (2) such access control policies are strictly enforced by bidirectional model transformations. Each collaborator obtains a filtered local copy of the model containing only those model elements which they are allowed to read; write access control policies are checked on the server upon submitting model changes. We illustrate the approach and carry out an initial scalability assessment using a case study of the MONDO EU project."

Currently vendors provide low-level APIs and basic primitives to program drones, making mission development a task-specific and  error-prone activity. As a consequence, current approaches are affordable only for users that have a strong technical expertise. Then, it emerges the need for software engineering techniques supporting the definition, development, and realization of missions involving swarms of autonomous drones while guaranteeing the safety today's users expect. In this paper we consider mission specifications expressed through a domain-specific modeling language which can be effectively used by end-users with no technical expertise, e.g., firefighters and rescue workers. Our generation method automatically derives the lower level logic that each drone must perform to accomplish the specified mission, prevents collisions between drones and obstacles, and ensures the preservation of no-fly zones."

One kind of problem is array index accesses where the index is outside the specified value range. The C language does not specify the behaviour in such cases, which clearly violates the requirements for safe code. In this paper, the approach of the model-based development tool 'ASCET' is explained, and the experiences of two case studies that describe the adoption of index protection are presented."

These functions lead to process and topology variability, which result in development and reuse challenges for software engineers in practice. This paper presents an approach aiming at improving the development and derivation of one IAM software family within Siemens. The approach integrates feature modeling with domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) for variability representation. Moreover, by combining code generation techniques, the configuration of variability models can be used to automate the software derivation. We report on a case study of applying the approach in practice. The outcome shows the enhancement of variability representation by introducing DSMLs and the improvement on automating software derivation. Finally, we present the lessons learned during the execution of this case study."

Therefore the design of these systems involves multi-disciplinary teams, for the development of the electronic devices and embedded firmware, but also for the design of the physical components. This intimate coupling of disparate elements makes correctness analysis very complex. Composite requirements have to be verified. In many application domains some of these requirements come from standardization documents. One of the main challenges is to make the variety of experts coordinate towards the satisfaction of these requirements, in spite of the fact that they are accustomed to focusing on their domain-specific issues, with their specialized tools. The aim of the method proposed here is to provide a unified testing framework to enable the validation of cross-disciplinary requirements. Since we target a general-purpose solution, usable by all disciplines, the method is specified using an abstract modeling language, namely SysML."

Over the years such languages can change, for instance as part of a tool update. When migrating existing models, changes in syntax directly affect the placement of elements in their diagrams. Increasing the size of certain nodes may for example result in node overlaps. In this paper we propose two methods based on graph drawing techniques to adjust the layout of existing diagrams after migration. Although we designed these techniques for diagram migration, they are applicable to other scenarios as well, such as users interactively adding or resizing nodes. We evaluate the techniques based on real world diagrams from the LabVIEW suite and discuss the scenarios each technique seems best suited for."

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a model-centric software development approach, which promises better maintainability. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the existence and influence of TD in the context of MDE. This paper investigates the code-level TD in MDE projects, which is incurred during code generation. We evaluated 16 open-source and non-trivial GMF/EMF-based MDE projects using bad smells, which are widely-accepted TD indicators. The results demonstrate that MDE is not TD-free, and code generators also incur TD, similarly to developers. In fact, the generated code usually contains more TD than handwritten code, which influences significantly the maintenance of MDE projects."

                    "Mostly the development of domain specific modeling languages (DSML) follows the traditional model driven engineering practices. First the syntax and semantics of the language are defined (at meta-level) and then it is used for the development of user models.  In certain situations, it is hard even to conceptualize the demands of the user, let alone the definition of the language.  Agile methods for software development suggest that the development activities should be performed alongside a client stakeholder for incremental development of the system.  This approach helps in the elicitation of requirements in parallel to the actual development of the system. We followed this approach for developing a domain specific modeling language and its tooling for a local government project, Brest Metropole.  The project aimed at filling the communication gap between the elected representatives (politicians) and the bureaucracy (government officers).  We used a modeling methodology that does not restrict a modeler's interaction to a single abstraction level.  Thus a modeler can develop both models and metamodels at the same time, where the definition of one helps in defining the other. In this article, we explain our experiences from this project and share the lessons learnt."

Recently, several papers discussing how industries use MDE have been published and they have contradictory findings. In this paper we report lessons learned from our collaborations with three large companies. We found that it is important to distinguish between descriptive models (used for documentation) and prescriptive models (used for development) to better understand the adoption of modelling in industry. Our findings are valuable for both academia and industry. A better understanding of modeling in large companies can help academia conceiving innovative MDE solutions that can have a real impact in industry. On the other hand, industry can better understand how to properly exploit MDE and what to expect from it."

                    "Process-aware information systems (PAIS) are systems relying on processes, which involve human and software resources to achieve concrete goals. There is a need to develop approaches for modeling, analysis, improvement and monitoring processes within PAIS. These approaches include process mining techniques used to discover process models from event logs, find log and model deviations, and analyze performance characteristics of processes. The representational bias (a way to model processes) plays an important role in process mining. The BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) standard is widely used and allows to build conventional and understandable process models. In addition to the flat control flow perspective, subprocesses, data flows, resources can be integrated within one BPMN diagram. This makes BPMN very attractive for both process miners and business users, since the control flow perspective can be integrated with data and resource perspectives discovered from event logs. In this paper, we describe and justify robust control flow conversion algorithms, which provide the basis for more advanced BPMN-based discovery and conformance checking algorithms. Thus, on the basis of these conversion algorithms low-level models (such as Petri nets, causal nets and process trees) discovered from event logs using existing approaches can be represented in terms of BPMN. Moreover, we establish behavioral relations between Petri nets and BPMN models and use them to adopt existing conformance checking and performance analysis techniques in order to visualize conformance and performance information within a BPMN diagram. We believe that the results presented in this paper can be used for a wide variety of BPMN mining and conformance checking algorithms. We also provide metrics for the processes discovered before and after the conversion to BPMN structures. Cases for which conversion algorithms produce more compact or more complicated BPMN models in comparison with the initial models are identified."

                    "Systems of systems exhibit characteristics that pose difficulty in modelling and predicting their overall performance capabilities, including the presence of operational independence, emergent behaviour, and evolutionary development. When considering systems of systems within the autonomous defence systems context, these aspects become increasingly critical, as constraints on the performance of the final system are typically driven by hard constraints on space, weight and power. System execution modelling languages and tools permit early prediction of the performance of model-driven systems; however, the focus to date has been on understanding the performance of a model rather than determining whether it meets performance requirements, and only subsequently carrying out analysis to reveal the causes of any requirement violations. Moreover, such an analysis is even more difficult when applied to several systems cooperating to achieve a common goal—a system of systems. In this article, we propose an integrated approach to performance prediction of model-driven real-time embedded defence systems and systems of systems. Our architectural prototyping system supports a scenario-driven experimental platform for evaluating model suitability within a set of deployment and real-time performance constraints. We present an overview of our performance prediction system, demonstrating the integration of modelling, execution and performance analysis, and discuss a case study to illustrate our approach."

                    "Model transformation is a key enabling technology of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Existing model transformation languages are shaped by and for MDE practitioners—a user group with needs and capabilities which are not necessarily characteristic of modelers in general. Consequently, these languages are largely ill-equipped for adoption by end-user modelers in areas such as requirements engineering, business process management, or enterprise architecture. We aim to introduce a model transformation language addressing the skills and requirements of end-user modelers. With this contribution, we hope to broaden the application scope of model transformation and MDE technology in general. We discuss the profile of end-user modelers and propose a set of design guidelines for model transformation languages addressing them. We then introduce Visual Model Transformation Language (VMTL) following these guidelines. VMTL draws on our previous work on the usability-oriented Visual Model Query Language. We implement VMTL using the Henshin model transformation engine, and empirically investigate its learnability via two user experiments and a think-aloud protocol analysis. Our experiments, although conducted on computer science students exhibiting only some of the characteristics of end-user modelers, show that VMTL compares favorably in terms of learnability with two state-of the-art model transformation languages: Epsilon and Henshin. Our think-aloud protocol analysis confirms many of the design decisions adopted for VMTL, while also indicating possible improvements."

                    "The cost savings introduced by Web services through code reuse and integration opportunities have motivated many businesses to develop Web APIs, with ever increasing numbers opting for the REST architectural style. RESTful Web APIs are decomposed in multiple resources, which the client can manipulate through HTTP interactions with well-defined semantics. Getting the resource in the desired state might require multiple client–server interactions, what we define as a RESTful conversation. RESTful conversations are dynamically guided by hypermedia controls, such as links. Thus, when deciding whether and how to use a given RESTful service, the client might not be aware of all the interactions which are necessary to achieve its goal. This is because existing documentation of RESTful APIs describes the static structure of the interface, exposing low-level HTTP details, while little attention has been paid to conceptual, high-level, modeling of the dynamics of RESTful conversations. Low-level HTTP details can be abstracted from during the design phase of the API, or when decid- ing which API to use. We argue that, in these situations, visual models of the required client–server interactions might increase developers’ efficiency and facilitate their understanding. Thus, to capture all possible interaction sequences in a given RESTful conversation, we propose RESTalk, an extension to the BPMN Choreography diagrams to render them more concise and yet sufficiently expressive in the specific REST domain. We also report on the results obtained from an exploratory survey we have conducted to assess the maturity of the field for a domain-specific language and to obtain feedback for future improvements of RESTalk."

To help practitioners and researchers in writing OCL constraints for their specific problem at hand, we developed a tool called interactive OCL (iOCL) for interactively specifying constraints on a given model. The basic philosophy behind the tool is to present only those details (e.g., operations) of OCL to modelers that are valid at a given step of constraint specification process, in addition to helping modelers with its syntax. Our ultimate aim is to reduce the effort required to specify constraints, subsequently lowering down training cost and increasing the correctness of the constraints. iOCL is a web-based application that integrates other tools including Eclipse OCL for validation and evaluation of OCL constraints, and EsOCL for automatically generating valid instances of models that satisfy the specified constraints."

Automatically co-evolving OCL constraints w.r.t. the evolved OOM is challenging since alternative resolutions can be applied but also a resolution cannot be applied to any arbitrary constraint. In this paper, we present SAC-OCL an Eclipse-based tool to automatically co-evolve OCL constraints when an OOM evolves. In contrast to existing tools, SAC-OCL propose alternative resolutions for an impacted OCL constraint and propose only the appropriate resolutions that can be applied on the impacted constraint. Our evaluation on six case studies shows an average correct co-evolution rate of 92%."

For this purpose, we propose a specification method that combines scenario-based modeling and graph transformations. The specifications are executable and can be analyzed via simulation. We furthermore developed a formal synthesis procedure that can find inconsistencies or prove the specification's realizability. This method is implemented in ScenarioTools, an Eclipse-based tool suite that combines the Scenario Modeling Language, an extended variant of LSCs, and graph transformations modeled with Henshin. The particular novelty is the synthesis support for systems with dynamic structure."

					"Mickaël Kerboeuf"
				abstract
					"The legacy transformations dealing with domain specific data gathers important expertise. Nevertheless, in many cases, have to be rewritten in order to make them apply to semantically equivalent but structurally incompatible data. According to the complexity of the transformation, rewriting them can quickly become a difficult and error-prone task. We propose a coevolution approach to enable the reuse of legacy transformations instead of their rewriting. In this approach, the data conforming to the reuse context coevolve into data conforming to the legacy transformation context. Legacy transformation is applied and the result is migrated back to the reuse context. In this paper, we introduce ModifRoundtrip, a plug-in for the Eclipse development environment. It promotes the reuse of legacy transformations, providing guidance for the user during reuse process. Reuse process is done automatically, but ModifRoundtrip provides interaction points to the user to indicate custom reuse scenarios."

First, we build a graphical interface for model construction and simulation, which is more intuitive than the existed command-line based toolchain. Furthermore, to enhance the original BIP verification tool RTD-Finder, we translate the graphical model to a labeled transition system for a thorough verification in verifier VCS. Finally, we can generate executable C++ code directly from the graphical model. Tsmart-BIPEX has been successfully applied in the development of a real-world train network controller."

				abstract
					"An important task in product line architecture (PLA) modeling is developing the involved variation points and maintaining their conformance to product line features. However, existing modeling tools and approaches still require manual development of variation points and manual maintenance of feature-PLA relations, which is expensive and error prone. In this paper, we introduce a new PLA modeling environment named ArchFeature. It can automatically manage variation points in the PLA model, create and maintain feature-PLA relations, and derive new architectural instances. The key idea of ArchFeature is to develop the product line features and PLA side-by-side in the same environment, and integrate their specifications in a single model. The goal is to reduce the modeling effort and increase the quality of the PLA models."

		Keynote "Resurrecting Laplace’s Demon: The Case for Deterministic Models"
			abstract " In 1814, Pierre-Simon Laplace published an argument for determinism in the universe, arguing that if someone (a demon) were to know the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, then their past and future values for any given time are completely determined and can be calculated from the laws of classical mechanics. This principle, of course, has been roundly invalidated by quantum mechanics, and yet the laws of classical mechanics continue to be extremely useful for prediction.
In this talk, I will argue that models plays different (complementary) roles in engineering and science, and that deterministic models have historically proved proved even more valuable in engineering than in science. Moreover, I will show that deterministic models for cyber-physical systems, which combine computation with physical dynamics, remain elusive. I will argue that the next big advance in engineering methods must include deterministic models for CPS, and I will show that such models are both possible and practical. "

		Keynote "Grand Challenges, Grand Responses?"
		    abstract "The world is facing a period of unprecedented change and the resultant grand challenges demand a coordinated and significant response from all parties including scientists and engineers, academics, policy makers and citizens. Environmental change is arguably the greatest challenge and this talk will focus on the role of digital technology in both the understanding of the complexities of the natural environment and also in determining well-founded adaptation and mitigation strategies for a range of environmental problems including climate change. The talk builds on over five years of experience in working with earth and environmental scientists in providing tools to help move towards a new kind of science as demanded by areas such as climate change, a science that is more open, integrative and collaborative for example. The research includes the application of contemporary areas of digital innovation including cloud computing, Internet of Things technology and emerging areas of data science. But what does this have to do with Models? The systems we are building are highly complex both in terms of the underlying digital technologies and also in the phenomena being observed. New techniques are urgently required to help us to master this complexity and the Models community is the keeper of one of the most powerful tools in this area - namely abstraction. Is the Models community focusing on the right problems though at the right scale and does it have the ambition to take on such grand challenges? Grand challenges demand grand responses - through this keynote, and building on the insights last year from Steve Easterbrook, I would like to provoke a discussion over what this might mean for Models going forward."

		Keynote "The Straight Line is Ungodly"
			abstract " Model-based approaches are not thriving, and the blame is usually laid at the feet of the unsophistication of software engineers. Yet software engineers may tacitly know something that the formal folks seldom discuss: Software systems are complex, and it is only simple problems that yield to formal approaches, including most modeling approaches—especially the analytical and computer-supported ones.
A system is complex proportional to its number of distinct, meaningful tops. However, these « tops » are rarely separable, so independent models based on such formalisms are relatively impotent. And such models are abstractions (i.e., they discard information) to the degree they are formal: and Gödel, Heisenberg, Rosen and a host of others note that there’s always a ghost in the machine. This matters more and more as we face increased complexity.
I will propose that modeling efforts be redirected to the more realistic, logically inconsistent, human ways of understanding ourselves and our interactions with computers. Object-orientation started with Kay’s operational models that would become objects; we see them again in Model-View-Controller-User. Both of these approaches emphasize the need to mix multiple concurrent perspectives (called roles) when analyzing a system. DCI is one paradigm that provides a single computational model while accommodating “tops” for both the left and right brain, and it bridges the abstraction of modeling with concrete implementation. I will argue that design is less about reifying extrinsic, abstract models than it is about creating a “habitable » reality close to the implementation, guided by human mental models. Last, I’ll touch on the kinds of socially constructed complex models as we find in patterns, which were explicitly created out of a dissatisfaction with the ability of formal models to add value."

		Tutorial "Empirical Research in Model Based Software Engineering"

Thus, the evaluation of modelling techniques, languages and tools is needed in order to assess their advantages and disadvantages, to ensure their applicability to different contexts, their ease of use, and other issues such as skills and costs. However, many papers submitted to the MODELS conference lack empirical validations of their proposed methods/techniques. This tutorial offers an introduction to empirical methods in software engineering and thereby aims to equip researchers in the MODELS community with knowledge required to perform evaluations. This tutorial is offered by a group of people with broad experience in several types of empirical studies (including experiments, surveys, case studies, action research)."

		Tutorial "Modeling Reactive Systems with the Scenario Modeling Language and ScenarioTools"
			abstract "Software-intensive systems in many domains consist of multiple cooperating reactive components. The distributed and concurrent nature of these systems makes the software development difficult. Key to avoiding the costly iterations is having a precise and consistent specification. In this tutorial, we present a powerful formal, scenario-based method for modeling reactive system specifications. Software engineers can specify the inter-component behavior by a set of scenarios. Each scenario describes what the system must or must not do in a certain situation and in reaction to certain events. This fits how engineers conceive and communicate the behavior during the early design. Specifications can be executed, which allows engineers to understand the interplay of the scenarios. Inconsistencies can be detected through formal synthesis algorithms. For curious beginners, but also for experienced reactive systems modelers, we introduce scenario-based modeling and give a hands-on experience on its strengths and challenges. In part 1 we overview the modeling methodology and introduce Live Sequence Charts (LSCs) and a textual variant, the Scenario Modeling Language (SML). We also introduce ScenarioTools, which supports the modeling and analysis of SML specifications. In part 2, we interactively model parts of a car-to-x system. We reflect on the method and discuss research opportunities."

		Tutorial "Multi-level Modelling with MetaDepth"
			abstract "Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) promotes models as the primary artefacts in the software development process, from which code for the final application is derived. Standard approaches to MDE (like those based on MOF or EMF) advocate a two-level meta-modelling setting where domain-specific modelling languages are defined through a meta-model, which is instantiated to build models at the meta-level below. Multi-level modelling — also called deep meta-modelling — extends the standard approach to meta-modelling by enabling modelling at an arbitrary number of meta-levels, not necessarily two. This approach leads to simpler models in situations where the type-object pattern or some of its variants arises. In this tutorial, we will discuss the motivation for multi-level modelling and explain its basic concepts. These will be illustrated in practice with the MetaDepth tool, developed by the lecturers. The tutorial will also cover the use of constraint and model management languages (e.g., for code generation or model-to-model transformation) in a multi-level setting, and will finish by introducing more advanced multi-level concepts."

		Tutorial "ARCADIA in a Nutshell"
			abstract "The ARCADIA/Capella Domain Specific Modeling Language (DSML) is inspired by UML/SysML and NAF standards, and shares many concepts with these languages. It is the result of an iterative definition process driven by systems and software architects working in a broad spectrum of business domains (transportation, avionics, space, radar, etc.). It enforces an approach structured on successive engineering phases which establishes clear separation between needs (operational need analysis and system need analysis) and solutions (logical and physical architectures), in accordance with the IEEE 1220 standard. The Capella workbench is an Eclipse application (Polarsys project) implementing the ARCADIA method providing both a DSML and a dedicated toolset. This tutorial will demonstrate the benefits of using both ARCADIA and Capella on a simple case study. It will guide you into the first steps of using ARCADIA, starting with the Analysis levels of the case study. It will then show you how the Capella tool, with the help of the ARCADIA method, will help you design more efficiently both Logical and Physical Architectures."

		Tutorial "Technologies and Design Patterns for Model-based Development of Cyber-physical Systems"
			abstract "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are complex engineering systems that interact directly with the physical world. They generally combine different engineering technologies, (e.g., mechanical, electrical) with embedded software, which is primarily responsible for monitoring and control functions. Traditional design approaches for such systems were based on an early decomposition into technology-centric subsystems, which were developed separately and then integrated towards the end of the development cycle. In contrast, modern CPS design takes a more holistic approach, which allows for increased flexibility in allocating functional responsibilities to the most appropriate technologies. This is made possible through more extensive and more effective use of computer-based engineering models. A key engineering challenge is how to construct and analyze models of such complex systems. To that end, a new generation of computer-based modeling languages has emerged. In this tutorial, we consider two industry standard modeling languages from this category, SysML and MARTE. We explore the rationale behind them, the relationships between them, and how they can be combined for effective and agile CPS design. Practical examples are used throughout to illustrate the various language concepts and their usage."

		Tutorial "Applying Model Driven Engineering Technologies in the Creation of Domain Specific Modeling Languages"
			abstract "Model Driven Engineering (MDE) brings together multiple technologies and critical innovations and formalizes them into the next wave of software development methods.

The three main MDE categories include the development of Domain Specific Languages (DSL), Domain Specific Editors (and Views), and Domain Specific Transformation Engines or Generators. Expressed in terms of language development technology, these mirror the development of the Abstract Syntax, Concrete Syntax and Semantics of a new Domain Specific Language. This tutorial will cover the basic effective patterns, principles and practices for developing these MDE software artifacts. The tutorial will show how to apply these concepts as effective means with which to both raise levels of abstraction and domain specificity and thus increase power and value of tools and languages that allow developers to tackle the complexities of today’s software systems. It will also show how to effectively leverage abstraction without sacrificing the ability to robustly and precisely refine these abstractions to solve complex real world problems. To show these patterns and principles in action, this tutorial will cover the details of how to leverage MDE Language Workbenches and frameworks in support of robust software development."

However, evolution issues are critical, complex and costly to manage. They concern requirements, architecture, design, source code, documentation, integration as well as deployment. They also typically affect various kinds of models (data, behavioural, domain, source code or goal models). Addressing and managing these varieties of changes is essential. Models and meta-models, the cornerstone of complex software systems’ abstraction, represent a powerful mean for facing software evolution challenges by ensuring a more abstract and expressive modelling of software evolution. They can help and guide software evolution, and can enforce and reduce critical risks and important involved resources. The workshop puts the focus on Models and Evolution by considering two main sides:
(1) Managing software evolution needs by relying on the high-level abstraction power of models and meta-models.
(2) Managing models and metamodels evolution needs by putting attention to their increasing evolution issues as they become primary artefacts and to the need of co-evolution of all related software artefacts."

		Workshop "ModComp"
			abstract "Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) have been proven to effectively reduce software development complexity by (i) shifting the focus from source code to models and (ii) breaking down the set of desired features and their intricacy into smaller sub-modules, respectively. Moreover, the interplay of MDE and CBSE approaches is gaining recognition as a very promising means to boost the development of software systems by reducing costs and risks and shorten time-to-market. While several attempts to effectively combine MDE and CBSE have been documented, there are still unsolved clashes raising when exploiting interplay of MDE and CBSE, mostly due to mismatches in the related terminology as well as to differences in their basic essence.
As satellite event of MoDELS, the goal of ModComp’16 is to gather researchers and practitioners to share opinions, propose solutions to open challenges and generally explore the frontiers of interweaving between MDE and CBSE."

		Workshop "MoDeVVa"
			abstract "MoDeVVa offers a forum for researchers and practitioners who are working on Verification & Validation and Models-driven Engineering. The major questions of interest in MoDeVVa concern the mutual benefits of MDE and V&V: How can models-driven engineering improve V&V?, and How can V&V leverage the techniques around models-driven engineering? In 2016 we put an emphasis on making the V&V activities of MDE artefacts a systematic process. This includes modeling the V&V activities, investigating the synergies between them or composing different V&V activities to increase the confidence in the verification results."

		Workshop "EXE"
			abstract "Executable models have the potential of bringing major benefits to the development of complex systems, as they provide abstractions of complex system behaviors and allow for the performance of early analyses of that behavior. Despite the potential benefits of executable models, there are still many challenges to solve, such as the lack of maturity in the definition of and tooling for executable modeling languages, and the limited experience with executable modeling in much of the software development industry. The objective of this workshop is to draw attention to the potentials and challenges of executable modeling and advance the state-of-the-art in executable modeling. We aim at bringing together researchers working towards overcoming challenges in executable modeling, as well as practitioners from different application domains and application contexts of executable modeling. The workshop intends to provide a forum for exchanging recent results, ideas, opinions, requirements, and experiences in executable modeling."

		Workshop "FlexMDE"
			abstract "Over the last years, numerous modeling platforms have been developed to simplify and automate many steps of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) processes. However, still several challenges have to be solved for enabling a wider adoption of MDE. One of the most important impediments in adopting MDE tools is related to the reduced flexibility of existing modeling platforms that do not permit to relax or enforce their rigidity depending on the stages of the applied development process. For instance, EMF does not permit to enter models which are not conforming to a metamodel. On one hand this allows only valid models to be defined, but on the other, it makes the corresponding pragmatics more difficult. Thus there is an increasing need for techniques supporting flexibility in a wide range of modeling activities, including metamodel, model, and model transformation development and reuse. The workshop aims at identifying the difficulties in the current practice of MDE related to the lack of flexibility, and soliciting contributions of ideas, concepts, and techniques also from other areas of software development which could be useful to revise certain MDE fundamental typing concepts, to facilitate flexible reuse of MDE artefacts, and to define agile model sketching techniques."

		Workshop "OCL"
			abstract "Limitations of graphical notations encourage the development of text-based modeling languages that either integrate with or replace graphical notations for modeling. Typical examples of such languages are OCL, textual MOF, Epsilon, and Alloy. The goal of this workshop is to create a forum where researchers and practitioners interested in building models using OCL or other kinds of textual languages can directly interact, report advances, share results, discuss appropriate standards and showcase tools on any aspect of textual modeling and analysis."

		Workshop "GEMOC"
			abstract "To cope with complexity, modern software-intensive systems are often split in different concerns to serve the needs of diverse stakeholders. These different concerns are often associated with specialized description languages and technologies, which are based on concern-specific problems and solution concepts. Software developers are thus faced with the challenging task of integrating the different languages and associated technologies used to produce software artifacts in the different concern spaces.
The proposed GEMOC 2016 will be a full-day workshop that brings together researchers and practitioners in the modeling languages community to discuss the challenges associated with integrating multiple, heterogeneous modeling languages. The languages of interest range from requirements, to design and runtime languages, and include both general-purpose and domain-specific languages. Challenges related to engineering composable languages, well-formed semantic composition of languages and reasoning about systems described using heterogeneous languages are of particular interest. Following the three previous editions, a major objective is to continue collaborations and to expand a community that is focused on solving the problems arising from the globalization of modeling languages; i.e., the use of multiple DSLs to support coordinated development of diverse aspects of a system."

		Workshop "MULTI"
			abstract "As interest in multi-level modelling grows, and the range of multi-level modelling tools expands, there is growing interest in consolidating the key principles of the paradigm and clarifying the essential differences between heterogeneous approaches.  Although multi-level modelling has now been used successfully in a variety of industrial projects and standards initiatives, there is still no clear consensus on what the paradigm actually entails and how it should be applied. For example, there are different views on whether it is sound to combine instance facets and type facets into so-called clabjects, whether strict metamodeling is too restrictive, and what tool architectures provide the best framework for modelling with multiple classification levels. This lack of a foundational consensus is mirrored by the lack of a common focus in current multi-level tools. The goal of MULTI 2016 is to address these challenges and continue the community building established in the previous workshops. In particular, the goal is to encourage the community to delineate different approaches to multi-level modelling and define objective ways to evaluate their respective strengths/weaknesses."

		Workshop "HuFaMo"
			abstract "Modeling is a genuinely human enterprise, so many of the questions related to modeling can only be answered by empirical studies of human factors. The HuFaMo workshop series is the premier venue for early stage empirical research involving human factors in modeling. Our goal is to improve the state of the science and professionalism in empirical research in the Model Based Engineering community. Typical examples of such questions might consider the usability of a certain approach such as a method or language, or the emotional states or personal judgements of modelers. We invite submissions regarding empirical studies of emotion, cognition, personality traits of modelers as well as studies about activities and communities of modelers, their culture and capabilities. Beyond conventional papers, we also seek to publish study designs, negative results, and, in fact, suggestions for actual studies to be carried out at the workshop."

		Workshop "MRT"

The use of models during runtime extends the use of modeling techniques beyond the design and implementation phases. The goal of this workshop is to look at issues related to developing appropriate model-driven approaches to managing and monitoring the execution of systems. We aim to continue the discussion of research ideas and proposals from researchers who work in relevant areas such as MDE, software architectures, reflection, and autonomic and self-adaptive systems, and provide a “state-of-the-art” research assessment expressed in terms of challenges and achievements."

		Workshop "VOLT"
			abstract "Model transformations are everywhere in software development, implicitly or explicitly. They have been described as “the heart and soul of Model-Driven Development (MDD)”. Several experts have identified the verification of model transformations as one of the grand challenges of MDD. Despite some recent activity in the field, the work on the verification of model transformations remains scattered and a clear perspective on the subject is still not in sight. Furthermore, current model transformation tools most often lack verification techniques to support such activities. The Fifth International Workshop on the Verification Of modeL Transformation is one of the most accurate venues to offer researchers a dedicated forum to classify, discuss, propose, and advance verification techniques dedicated to model transformations. VOLT promotes discussions between theoreticians and practitioners from academy and industry, given its ideal co-location with MODELS. VOLT’s interest spans both to academic and industrial practices. One of the goals of the forum is to collect enough industrial case studies so that those problems can be stated at a theoretical level."
